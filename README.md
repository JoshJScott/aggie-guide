# Aggie-Guide
## What is Aggie Guide:
  Aggie Guide is an information sharing website that allows users to create guides to help fellow aggies. Each guide contains three core elements: High-Level Overview, Resources to Learn, and some Learning Objectives.
 
  * High-Level Overview - Shares the purpose of the guide and sums up what you want to know.
  * Resources to Learn  - Provides external resources for the user to learn about the topic
  * Learning Objectives - Learning Objectives allow for users to see if they really got the information the guide is designed to give
  
## Technologies Used and Why:
  - ReactJS
  - Typescript
  - NodeJS
  - Firebase
  - Figma

## Setting up the Project:
  - Need an IDE of your choice (My recommendation is Visual Studio Code it has nice features)
  - Need the React Library
  - Download NodeJS
  - Firebase
  
## How to Contribute:
  - Fork repository if necessary 
  - Use git checkout the furthest commit on the main branch (AKA the head of the main branch)
  - Create your own branch to work on (ideally name it something useful as others will have to read it) 
  - Create a feature OR check out our trello board for tasks to be done
  - Commit your feature to your branch
  - If other commits have been made on the main branch prior to your feature being done, use git rebase <head> to get the furthest commit on the main branch
  - Fix any possible issues with the rebase
  - Test the feature with a variety of test cases (not unit testing, just make sure most things that could happen to it are accounted for)
  - Create a pull request
  - Someone will review the code to ensure we are all adding non-faulty code
  - Resolve any merge conflicts as they appear and merge to master branch
